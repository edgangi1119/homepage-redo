            <strong className="text-xl text-gray-900">Meeting Quality</strong> — This is sales development, not lead gen. Prospects are qualified through live conversation before they ever hit your calendar — ICP fit, buying authority, intent, and value prop understanding confirmed on the call. They arrive as opportunities, not names on a list.

            <strong className="text-xl text-gray-900">Market Intelligence</strong> — Every call is a data point. Real objections, competitive intel, timing signals, and messaging validation — straight from live conversations, not inferred from open rates.
